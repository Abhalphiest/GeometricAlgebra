# GeometricAlgebra
A variety of small projects relating to Geometric Algebra and Conformal Geometric Algebra.


Right now, there is a logisim circuit that performs a conformal product, and a MIPS assembly program that 
computes a 3 dimensional geometric product (to illuminate the possibility of a fast math library for geometric algebra)

Further work may be contributed in the future, but this investigation is indefinitely on hold at the current moment.
